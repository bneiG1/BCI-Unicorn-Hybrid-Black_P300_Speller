# Real-Time Processing and Optimization

## Real-Time Loop
- Continuous data acquisition from Unicorn Hybrid Black
- Low-latency signal processing and classification
- Immediate feedback via GUI

## Optimization Strategies
- Minimize processing latency at each stage
- Profile and vectorize matrix operations
- Use efficient data structures and cache intermediate results
- Ensure system can process and respond within the inter-stimulus interval (<100 ms per trial)

## Data Streaming
- Support continuous, low-latency data flow from Unicorn SDK
- Error handling for dropped packets or device disconnects

## Performance Metrics
- Processing latency (ms per trial)
- Memory usage (MB)
- Classification accuracy (%)
- Information Transfer Rate (bits/min)
- System responsiveness (user-perceived delay)

See [overview.md](overview.md) for the full system architecture.
